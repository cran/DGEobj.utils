Title: Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Analysis Utility Toolkit
Version: 1.0.6
Description: 
    Provides a function toolkit to facilitate reproducible RNA-Seq Differential Gene Expression (DGE)
    analysis (Law (2015) <doi:10.12688/f1000research.9005.3>).  The tools include both analysis 
    work-flow and utility functions: mapping/unit conversion, count normalization, accounting for 
    unknown covariates, and more.  This is a complement/cohort to the 'DGEobj' package that 
    provides a flexible container to manage and annotate Differential Gene Expression analysis results.
